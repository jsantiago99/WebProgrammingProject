This web programming project was part of my Web programming course in which we used what we learn over the course to build a store page. HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP were languages used to build out this process. Implemented mySQL database and used XAMPP to test database to ensure functionality is working correctly. In this project, we also learned how to implement cookies and login session.
