1.Clearly we don't want to store passwords in plaintext. Do some research and write a short paragraph about what you would do to make your passwords more security.

I would keep a notebook of all my passwords that can be stored in a safe location or use a very trusted password manager. However, I think writing passwords
on paper are a lot better because no hacker can hack and find my passwords within a database or anywhere in my computer in plaintext. 




2.What are some good/not so good ways to deal with forgotten passwords? List at least one of each.

Good way to deal with forgotten passwords are to have a link that asks for the persons email and then verifys their identity through security questions, and then 
after verifying that the email was in the database
incase they forgotten their username, then from there reset the password through a link.

A bad way to deal with forgotten password would be to send a password reset link to an email in the database without verifying the person entering the email.




3.What are some things to consider when implementing "Remember me" functionality? List at least two.

I would consider whether the Remember me functionality is for both the username and password or just the username.
The next thing I would consider is how remember me functionality will work, whether that is through a cookies or a generated token that can be saved with the userID in a database.






4.What are some best practices for cookies? List at least two.

Storing data to the server side
Keeping cookies minimal
Decide what would be better to be stored in a cookie vs a session









5.What is https?

HTTPS is Hypertext Transger Protocol Secure and its used to send data securely between a web browser and website because the protocol is encrypted to have secure data transfer.
